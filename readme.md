# GoMaBot (Go Matrix Bot)
The bare minimum to make a Matirx bot, that keeps the boring parts to the side.
Builts upon Mautrix SDK, and the codebase is _very_ minimal, to the point where one could see it as pointless.

How to help? Please please please come up with a better name than GoMaBot, I am very open for suggestions.
